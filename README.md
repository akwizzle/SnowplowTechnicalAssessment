# Snowplow Technical Assessment
I have made a basic shopping app where the user can add foods to a basket, buy what's in the basket or clear the contents of the basket.
The users actions are tracked by Snowplow Micro:
  -adding items to cart/basket
  -buying items
  -clearing the cart/basket
  -buying all items available (custom event)
  
 The app is accessible by running the shoppgui.py file and the tracker is implemented with the spTracker.py file.
